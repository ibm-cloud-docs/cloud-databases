# Getting to production for {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}}
{: #best-practices}

## Prework

1. Complete your data modeling and architectural reviews to ensure cloud-native alignment. If you need help with data modeling and architecture, contact the [IBM Garage](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/consult-with-ibm-garage) 
2. Determine the best method for your initial setup, including [Terraform, API, CLI, or UI methods](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-provisioning).
3. If you require the ability to manage your database's encryption key for data-at-rest, you must [Bring Your Own encryption Key (BYOK)](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-key-protect) when creating your database. This setup canâ€™t be changed after your instance is provisioned.
4. Make sure that [IAM access policies and resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview) are set up correctly for your business protocols.
5. Ensure that your account is [VRF-enabled](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#before-service-endpoint-enablement)
6. Understand your databases high availability model. This is covered in the "High-Availability" section of each database's documentation. 


## Sample "Getting to production" checklist

1. Create a database with the required disk, RAM, and virtual CPUs. While these scaling parameters can be changed after the initial provisioning, disks cannot be scaled down. 
2. If you would like hypervisor level isolation, or if you want to guarantee an amount of vCPUs to your database, ensure that your [database CPU allocation](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-provisioning#using-the-catalog) is provisioned to use `dedicated cores`.
3. Add users. (See the related documentation for your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} instance.)
4. Change the `Admin` Password
5. _Optional step for {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} only_: set up and validate [read-only replicas](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-read-only-replicas)
6. Set up Auto-Scaling policies if appropriate. 
   * Note: Default Auto-Scaling logic is the suggested baseline. Tune these parameters to your budget and use case. The recommended disk space reflects the minimum amounts that are needed, but note that disk capacity cannot be scaled down without a backup and restore. RAM and virtual CPUs (vCPUs) can scale up and down. Note that memory auto-scaling works based on disk I/O utilization to optimize page cache performance. Databases will not auto-scale when in-use memory approaches 100%; this is often the desired state.
   For more information on Auto-scaling capabilities, see the related documentation for your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} instance.  
7. Set up monitoring with Sysdig, AT, and LogDNA. At minimum, set alerts on:
   * [Sysdig](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig) - when disk usage is greater than 80% of provisioned capacity (we encourage you to use Auto-Scaling for disk capacity). We also encourage you to use, understand, and alert on all provided metrics like disk I/O or CPU usage. 
   * [Activity Tracker with LogDNA](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-activity-tracker) audit events for control plane actions, such as IP allowlist updates, scaling, or failed backups.
   * [Logging with LogDNA](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-logging) - any particular database-specific logs. 
   * If available, turn on granular in-database auditing (only available for {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} and {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} Enterprise Edition).
8. Set up an [IP allowlist](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-allowlisting) for your instance
9. Set [Private Endpoints](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-service-endpoints#private-endpoints). You might also choose to disable public endpoints (highly recommended if no connection is expected from outside IBM Cloud)
10. Make sure that your application uses TLS when connecting to the database. Insecure connections to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} are not allowed.
11. Thoroughly load test, and then load test again.
12. Validate the application's reconnect logic. For some applications retry is not enough and you must reconnect. Review the article, ["Unresponsive Redis Service"](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/error-detection-and-handling-with-redis/) for an example of implementation on {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis_full}}. 
13. Set up development and testing environments as separate instances, then work through this checklist again. Depending on your requirements, you might not want to use dedicated cores for these test environments. Not using dedicated cores helps to keep costs lower. 
14. Complete [Disaster Recovery](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-ha-dr) testing. Test restoring your application to a different IBM Cloud region. Ensure you are able to connect to a "restored" database with new connection details.
    * Understand your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirements and ensure that you can meet them with your database's configuration

To resolve a database's UUID, use the command `ibmcloud resource search <UUID>`. Other useful CLI commands are: `ibmcloud cdb about` and `ibmcloud cdb cxn`. For more information, see the [CLI plug-in reference documentation](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=databases-cli-plugin-cdb-reference).
