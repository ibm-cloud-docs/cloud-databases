# Whitelisting
{: #whitelisting} 

This content has been deprecated to reflect changes in terminology from `whitelist` to [`allowlists`](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=allowlists). Please update your bookmarks accordingly. 

You will find the updated terminology and references now at: **[`Allowlists`](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=allowlists)**

You will encounter continued references to this former terminolgy while we work to implement these deeper changes to code, API, and CLI commands.
