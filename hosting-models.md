# {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} Hosting Models
{: #hosting-models}

To allow for reliable resource allocation, {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} offers two hosting models: Shared Compute and Isolated Compute. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} Shared Compute is a cost-effective, flexible option for your database deployment. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} Isolated Compute is an appealing option for applications that require more precise control, security, or performance.
{: shortdesc}

## {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} Shared Compute
{: #hosting-models-shared-compute}

Shared compute uses shared host machines and {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} ensures that each separate customer instance is logically separated for data isolation and security.

Each database instance receives a deterministic CPU allocation. If an instance is provisioned without selecting a CPU amount, Shared Compute automatically allocates a small amount of CPU to your database up to a 2 core max. Automatic CPU is provided at a 1:8 ratio of CPU:RAM; therefore, a user with 1 GB RAM receives 1/8th of a CPU; an user with 8 GB RAM receives 1 CPU; and an user with 20 GB RAM receives 2 CPU due to the 2 CPU limit.

If you have higher performance requirements than 2 CPU, you can easily leverage the flexibility of the Shared model. With the ability to select the amount of CPU and RAM resources you receive, scale performance to fit your workload. Additionally, if you know that your instance will experience variable demand, use autoscaling to set not only the expected load and duration that would initiate resource scaling, but also the resource and cost limit your database will scale to.

Due to each service's individual requirements, {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} has minimums in place for all Shared Compute instances. When all instances are transitioned to Shared Compute, we will apply the same minimums to Shared Compute and Dedicated Core instances. Current users of multi-tenant will be grandfathered.
{: note}

## {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} Isolated Compute
{: #hosting-models-iso-compute}

Isolated Compute is the service for secure enterprise data hosting. By placing your deployment and all associated user-data operations on an isolated machine, {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} Isolated Compute provides dedicated computing resources and security.

At provisioning, select the CPU x RAM size of the machine to provision your database on â€” this machine will be dedicated to running this database instance, giving you hypervisor-level isolation between your instance and any other database. To further strengthen isolation, dedicated database management agents run alongside the database instance on the same isolated machines. IO bandwidth and network bandwidth will also be dedicated to the database instance.

Storage is still selected separately, allowing you to determine the number of [IOPS](#x3858854){: term} your database receives. Scale your database and change your machine size through your preferred method: the [dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}, the [{{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} CLI plug-in](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=databases-cli-plugin-cdb-reference), the [{{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api/cloud-databases-api-v5#introduction), or through [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/database){: external}.

CPU and RAM autoscaling is not supported on {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} Isolated Compute. Disk autoscaling is available. If you have provisioned an Isolated instance or switched over from a deployment with autoscaling, monitor your resources using [{{site.data.keyword.monitoringfull}} integration](/docs/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-monitoring), which provides metrics for memory, disk space, and disk I/O utilization. To add resources to your instance, manually scale your deployment.
{: note}

### Isolated Compute Sizing
{: #hosting-models-iso-compute-sizing}

Isolated Compute features 6 size selections:
- 4 CPU x 16 RAM
- 8 CPU x 32 RAM
- 8 CPU x 64 RAM
- 16 CPU x 64 RAM
- 32 CPU x 128 RAM
- 30 CPU x 240 RAM

The price of CPU and RAM resources remains the same.

## Switching hosting models
{: #hosting-models-switching}

To switch between our Shared and Isolated compute, select the model you want, review your resource selection, and switch. Switching hosting models does not cause downtime.

## Hosting model grandfathering
{: #hosting-models-grandfathering}

Current multi-tenant users that are automatically switched over to Shared Compute will begin to be charged for their CPU use starting November 2024.
{: important}

Existing multi-tenant customers will be transitioned to Shared Compute, including a gradual transition from free-for-all CPU allocation to the deterministic Shared Compute allocation.

All Dedicated Cores instances will be switched over to the nearest larger Isolated Compute size. To provision a Dedicated Cores instance before it is shut down, use the [{{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} CLI plug-in](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=databases-cli-plugin-cdb-reference){: external}, the [{{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api/cloud-databases-api-v5#introduction){: external}, or through [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/database){: external}.

New Shared Compute users, or users who switch over to Shared Compute on their own, will receive Shared Compute charging.
