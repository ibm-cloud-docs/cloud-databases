# Whitelisting
{: #whitelisting} 

This content is deprecated in documentation to reflect changes in terminology from `whitelist` to [`allowlists`](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-allowlisting). Code, API, and CLI commands will be updated in the future.

You will encounter continued references to this former terminology while we work to implement these deeper changes to code, API, and CLI commands.  
{: .note}

Please update your bookmarks to find the updated terminology and references now at: **[`Allowlists`](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-allowlisting)**
