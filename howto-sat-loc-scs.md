# Your service cluster
{: #icd-service-cluster}

As outlined in your initial ICD Satellite location deployment, your initial service cluster was established with the following hosts:

- three type **8x32** hosts (on AWS, three hosts of type **AWS m5d.2xlarge**)
- three type **32x128** hosts (on AWS, three hosts of type **AWS m5d.8xlarge**)

The three type **8x32** hosts are for IBM Cloudâ„¢ Databases (ICD) enabled by IBM Cloud Satellite internal use, while the three type **32x128** hosts are for your use.

## Growing your service cluster
{: #icd-service-cluster-grow}

As your service cluster grows, you might be required to add additional hosts. If required, add **32x128** hosts in increments of three (e.g., three type **8x32** hosts to six type **8x32** hosts, then nine type **8x32** hosts, and so on).

## Service cluster removal
{: #icd-remove-service-cluster}

Just as additional hosts are added as your data needs grow, as you downsize your service cluster, hosts will be automatically deleted when they are no longer needed.

## Verifying Service cluster storage assignment
{: #icd-service-cluster-verify-storage}

To verify a service cluster storage assignment, use the following command to list your service clusters and configurations:

```shell
ic sat storage assignment ls
```
