<!-- The title of your tutorial should be in active voice and and start with a verb. If you include product names, makes sure to use the non-trademarked short version keyref. -->
<!-- Make sure each H1/H2/H3/etc. heading is _unique_ to your tutorial by adding a short but human-readable identifier. For example, instead of just "#overview", use "#cd-kube-overview" -->

# Provision a

{: toc-services="containers, Registry"} <!-- Only if multi-service - use same values from services metadata above-->
{: toc-completion-time="10m"} <!-- Use same value from completion-time metadata above-->

<!-- The short description should be a single, concise paragraph that contains one or two sentences and no more than 50 words. Briefly mention what the user's learning goal is and include the following SEO keywords in the title short description: IBM Cloud, ServiceName, tutorial.--> 

In this tutorial, you learn how to set up a continuous integration and delivery pipeline for containerized applications running on the {{site.data.keyword.containershort_full}}. You set up source control, and then build, test, and deploy the code to different deployment stages. Then, you add integrations to other services like Slack notifications.

<!-- It's recommended to include an architectural diagram that shows how the services that are used in this tutorial interact. SVG is the recommended format. If you include a diagram, include a brief text-based description of the workflow shown in the diagram, using active voice to describe the workflow. This makes the content more searchable and improves accessibility. -->

{: figure caption="Figure 1. A diagram that shows the architecture for my tutorial."}

The pipeline that you create has the following architecture:
1. Workflow step 1
1. Workflow step 2
1. Workflow step 3
1. Workflow step 4

<!-- List any access, setup, or knowledge that the user must have before they start the tutorial. Be sure to link to any related documentation or resources to help the user complete these prerequisites.-->

<!-- Note: Currently no format for checkboxes. Let's check with design if required for first pass -->

* [Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started).
* [Set up the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Container Registry CLI and your registry namespace](/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-registry_setup_cli_namespace). 
* [Understand the basics of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/).

<!-- For each step in your tutorial, add an H2 section. The title should be task-oriented and descriptive. If you find your tutorial going over 9 steps, consider whether your substeps can be grouped differently or whether your tutorial should be a multi-part series. -->

## Create a development Kubernetes cluster
{: #cd-kube-dev-cluster}
{: step}

<!-- Introduce each major step with a description of what it will accomplish. If there are sequential substeps, use an ordered list for each substep. Don't include the step number. -->

First, you need to set up a Kubernetes cluster on the {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} service. {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} delivers powerful tools by combining Docker and Kubernetes technologies, an intuitive user experience, and built-in security and isolation to automate the deployment, operation, scaling, and monitoring of containerized apps in a cluster of compute hosts.

1. In the IBM Cloud catalog, go to the [Kubernetes Service](/kubernetes/catalog/cluster/create).
1. Select **Standard** as the cluster type, and select **2 MB / 1 Worker** as the machine type. All other options can be left as default.  
1. Click **Create** to create your cluster. Check the status of your cluster and worker nodes until they're in the Ready state. 

You'll need to wait until your workers are ready to move to the next step.

## Build your app locally
{: #cd-kube-build-app}
{: step}

<!-- For commands, introduce the command in a sentence first. Then surround what the user must enter in the command prompt with three backticks, and set the programming language if it applies. After the code block, add a {: pre} attribute to add a $ before the command and a copy link. --> 

You can build and run the application as you normally would using `mvn` for Java&trade; local development or `npm` for Node.js development.  You can also build a Docker image and run the application in a container to ensure consistent execution locally and on the cloud. Use the following steps to build your docker image.

1. Ensure your local Docker engine is started.

   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```
   {: pre}

1. Navigate to the generated project directory.

   ```sh
   cd <project name>
   ```
   {: pre}

1. Build the application locally.

   ```sh
   ibmcloud dev build
   ```
   {: pre}

   This might take a few minutes to run because all of the application dependencies are downloaded and a Docker image, which contains your application and all the required environment, is built.
