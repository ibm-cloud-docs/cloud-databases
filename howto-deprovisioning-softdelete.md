# Deleting your Deployment and Removing your Data
{: #deleting}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Databases instances are now softly deleted in production when you delete or deprovision the instance in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} keeps the formation in the "soft delete" state for 3 days before issuing a "delete". This is to address use cases when you accidentally delete an instance. You can now re-enable an existing soft-deleted instance on your own.

In order to completely delete your instance, you will need to use `ibmcloud resource reclamation-delete`.

## Reenabling from a soft delete

You are able to discover available soft deleted instances by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI [ibmcloud resource reclamations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_reclamations) command.

You may then "undelete" or recover an available soft deleted instance by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI [ibmcloud resource reclamation-restore](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_reclamation_restore) command.
