# Default alerts reference
{: #default-alerts}


{{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} integrates with {{site.data.keyword.monitoringfull}} to provide visibility into the health and performance of your database instances. Monitoring and alerting helps administrators to detect issues early, respond to resource constraints, and maintain service reliability. Starting in November 2025, {{site.data.keyword.monitoringfull_notm}} will automatically enable a default set of up to five critical alerts for each new and existing {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} instance when [platform metrics are enabled](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-platform_metrics_enabling). These alerts will monitor key resource metrics such as memory usage, disk I/O, and CPU load, and will be preconfigured to send notifications to the email of the account owner. 

This guide explains the critical alerts installed for your managed database. For each alert, we outline what the metric monitors, why it matters for performance and availability, and the recommended actions to take when the alert triggers. Use this reference to proactively manage capacity, prevent capacity or settings related outages, and maintain resiliency. 

## Setting up monitoring 
{: #default-alerts-set-up}

Default alerts are only installed if you integrate with {{site.data.keyword.monitoringfull_notm}} to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of their applications, services, and platforms. 

To begin collecting metrics for your database instance: 

1. Provision an instance of [{{site.data.keyword.monitoringfull_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/observability/catalog/ibm-cloud-monitoring).
1. Enable **Platform Metrics** in the same region as your database instance.
1. Access your monitoring dashboards from the [{{site.data.keyword.monitoringfull_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/observability/catalog/ibm-cloud-monitoring) section in the Cloud console under Observability.

Metrics for instances in multi-zone regions (MZRs) are available in-region. For single-zone regions (SZRs), metrics are forwarded to a designated MZR, for example *che01*.

## Critical alerts: Benefits and response guidance
{: #default-alerts-critical}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} provide a set of common and service-specific metrics to help you monitor performance and resource usage. Every metric supported by each database is listed in the Observability section of the documentation. For a few of critical metrics, at least one alert is set up to notify you when thresholds are exceeded. These alerts are explained below. To see the full list of metrics for each database, see the [ICD monitoring integration](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-monitoring). 

### PostgreSQL alerts
{: #default-alerts-postgresql}

| Alert   | Condition   | Explanation   |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| avg by(ibm_service_instance_name,ibm_service_instance,ibm_scope) (ibm_databases_for_postgresql_cpu_used_percent) | &gt; 0.95 | This metric tracks CPU usage for {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}}. When usage stays above 95%, the database may slow down, stall transactions, or cause application timeouts. Sustained CPU pressure is often due to inefficient queries, large workloads, or insufficient resources. Review and optimize expensive queries or scale compute resources to restore headroom. |
| max(min(ibm_databases_for_postgresql_disk_used_percent)) | &gt; 0.90 | Tracks the maximum disk usage across {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} instances. Above 90%, at least one instance is critically close to running out of space, risking blocked transactions and degraded performance. Expand storage, archive or purge unused data immediately. |
| avg(avg(ibm_databases_for_postgresql_disk_used_percent)) | &gt; 0.85 | This metric measures average disk utilization in {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}}. At &gt;85% usage, the system risks hitting critical limits that block writes, affect transaction logs, or cause outages. Free disk space is crucial for indexing, temporary tables, and WAL files. Expand storage allocation, archive or purge old data before capacity is exhausted. |

### MongoDB alerts
{: #default-alerts-mongodb}

| Alert | Condition | Explanation |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| avg by(ibm_service_instance_name,ibm_service_instance,ibm_scope) (ibm_databases_for_mongodb_cpu_used_percent) | &gt; 0.95 | CPU usage above 95% in {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} signals heavy query load or insufficient capacity. Sustained pressure impacts replication lag, write throughput, and query latency. Review slow queries with profiling tools, shard or index data where needed, or scale the instanceâ€™s CPU resources. |
| max(max(ibm_databases_for_mongodb_disk_used_percent)) | &gt; 0.90 | This metric tracks the maximum {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} disk usage across instances. At &gt;90%, journaling, replication, and storage engine operations may fail. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} requires free space for internal writes and recovery operations. Expand storage, archive or purge unused collections to prevent write failures. |
| ibm_databases_for_mongodb_connections | &gt;1000 | This metric shows active client connections to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}}. Surpassing 1,000 connections may overwhelm available resources, leading to errors or degraded performance. Connection surges often come from unpooled apps or misbehaving clients. Implement connection pooling and, if needed, scale the instance to handle demand. |

### MySQL alerts
{: #default-alerts-mysql}

| Alert | Condition | Explanation |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| avg by(ibm_service_instance_name,ibm_service_instance,ibm_scope) (ibm_databases_for_mysql_cpu_used_percent) | &gt; 0.95 | {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mysql}} CPU above 95% indicates that the system is overloaded with queries or background processes. This can delay transactions and degrade application performance. Tune inefficient queries (for example, via EXPLAIN plans) or scale compute capacity to handle demand. |
| avg(avg(ibm_databases_for_mysql_disk_used_percent)) | &gt; 0.85 | Average disk usage above 85% in {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mysql}} risks blocking writes and filling up logs or temp tables. Free space is critical for transaction logs and index operations. Expand storage or archive historical data before capacity issues arise. |
| max(min(ibm_databases_for_mysql_disk_used_percent)) | &gt; 0.90 | Maximum disk usage exceeding 90% indicates at least one {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mysql}} instance is critically close to running out of space. This can halt transactions and degrade stability. Add storage immediately, purge or archive unused tables to reduce pressure. |
| avg by (ibm_service_instance_name) (avg_over_time(ibm_databases_for_mysql_connection_used_percent[$__interval])) | &gt; 0.95 | This metric tracks percentage of used {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mysql}} connections. When it reaches 100%, new clients will be blocked, leading to connection errors. When connection usage exceeds 95%, increase max_connections cautiously or adopt connection pooling to avoid overload. |

| avg by(ibm_service_instance_name,ibm_service_instance,ibm_scope) (ibm_databases_for_elasticsearch_cpu_used_percent) | &gt; 0.95 | {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} CPU usage above 95% affects indexing, queries, and cluster responsiveness. Sustained overload risks node instability. Optimize queries, reduce shard counts, or scale compute resources. |
| avg by (ibm_service_instance_name,ibm_service_instance,ibm_scope) (ibm_databases_for_elasticsearch_cluster_status) | =0 | Cluster status = 0 indicates that {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} is red, meaning primary shards are missing or unassigned. This poses a risk of data loss. Check node health, ensure sufficient disk space, and reallocate shards. |
| avg(avg(ibm_databases_for_elasticsearch_disk_used_percent)) | &gt; 0.85 | {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} disk above 85% prevents new indices or replicas and risks cluster instability. Free space is vital for shard balancing and merging. Expand storage, delete or archive old indices. |
| avg by(ibm_service_instance_name,ibm_service_instance,ibm_scope) (ibm_databases_for_elasticsearch_jvm_heap_percent) | &gt; 95 | JVM heap above 95% in {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} indicates garbage collection pressure and risk of node crashes. Increase heap size cautiously, optimize queries, or scale the cluster to distribute load. |

### Redis alerts
{: #default-alerts-alerts}

| Alert | Condition | Explanation |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| avg(avg_over_time(ibm_databases_for_redis_memory_used_percent)) | &gt; 0.85 | {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} is memory-driven, and usage above 85% risks forced key evictions or OOM errors. High memory pressure can cause unpredictable data loss if eviction policies are triggered. Scale the memory allocation or enforce TTL/eviction policies aligned with application needs. |
| avg(avg_over_time(ibm_databases_for_redis_disk_used_percent)) | &gt; 0.85 | {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} persistence relies on disk space for snapshots and AOF logs. At &gt;85% usage, data persistence may fail, risking durability. Expand storage capacity or clean up unnecessary keys and backups. |
| topk(50,avg(max_over_time(ibm_databases_for_redis_connected_clients{$__scope}[$__interval])) by (ibm_resource)) | &gt; 9500 | This metric measures the number of connected {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} clients. Surpassing 9,500 can overwhelm networking resources, slow responses, or cause dropped connections. Ensure efficient client pooling and scale {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-redis}} instances if the workload requires more connections. |
