## Enabling {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} with Sysdig
{: #sysdig-monitor-enabling}

To enable Sysdig Monitor on {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}}, follow these steps:

1. Click the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} tile.
1. In the **Create** dialog box, do the following:
   - Select a location.
   - Select a pricing plan. For {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} with Sysdig Monitoring, choose **Graduated Tier - Sysdig Secure + Monitor**. For more information, see [Graduated Tier - Sysdig Secure + Monitor Pricing](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-pricing_plans#graduated_secure){: external}.

## Sysdig Dashboards
{: #sysdig-monitor-dashboards}

### CPU used per member (data only available with dedicated cores)
{: #sysdig-monitor-dashboards-cpu-used-per-member}

The usage that is presented in this dashboard is a percentage of total CPU being used, based on the number of cores in your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} instance. For example, if you have eight cores and your usage is 12.5%, then that percentage reflects that your database member is using 1 core's worth of CPU seconds; however, that does not guarantee that your member's workload is pinned to one core â€“ the workload might be distributed unevenly among your eight cores. In the same example, 25% usage reflects that your database member is using 2 core's worth of CPU seconds out of your available 8 cores.
